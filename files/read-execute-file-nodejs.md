Node.js is a powerful and versatile open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server-side. Unlike traditional JavaScript, which primarily runs in web browsers, Node.js enables the execution of JavaScript on the server, making it well-su ted for building scalable and high-performance network applications. Developed on the V8 JavaScript engine by Google, Node.js excels in handling asynchronous operations, making it particularly effective for building real-time applications, APIs, and microservices. Its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O operations contribute to efficient handling of concurrent requests, making Node.js a popular choice for building fast and scalable server-side applications. Additionally, Node.js has a vibrant ecosystem of packages and modules, facilitated by the npm package manager, allowing developers to leverage a rich set of tools and libraries to streamline development. Whether used for building web servers, command-line tools, or full-stack applications, Node.js empowers developers with a unified JavaScript environment across the entire software stack.
 

To read a Markdown file using JavaScript, you can use the fs (File System) module if you're working in a Node.js environment. If you are working in a browser environment, you can use the Fetch API to retrieve the file content. Here are examples for both scenarios:





This is an import statement
```js  
import React from 'react'
```


This is a function in javascript:
```js  
function foo(){
    let x = 1; 
}
```

Run the code using the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```
